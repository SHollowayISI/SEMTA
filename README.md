# SEMTA
MATLAB project for SEMTA

## Overview

This project simulates the SEMTA radar scenario, performs signal and data processing, and displays results. Note: this project is a bit older than the others, so there is more scratch work and commented lines. 

* Full simulation is run from "FullSystem_Simulation_SEMTA.m", or "FullSystem_AutomatedSimulation_SEMTA.m". 
* Settings, data, and results are passed through "scenario" object.
* Parameters are set through scenario initialization files, such as Scripts/ExampleScenario_SEMTA. AutomatedSimulation version loops through scenario files in Automated Testing/To Run/ directory.
